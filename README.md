- 👋 Hi, I’m @levikeplar
- 👀 I’m trying to learn everything I can about software development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python. I have finished a few projects and have also created my first Chrome Extension. All of my projects were created to fill holes in my current business.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would be helpful to learn. I have lots of ideas, but still a long way to go with coding experience.
